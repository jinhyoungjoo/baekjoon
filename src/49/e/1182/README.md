- Solutions: [C++](./1182.cpp)

### Problem Description
Given N integers, find the number of combinations where the sum of a subsequence is equal to a target sum.

### Algorithm
- The condition N is very small (<20), brute-forcing through all the subsequences is possible.
- Use backtracking to brute-force through the subsequences.

### Keywords
- Backtracking
- Brute Force
